	To plagiarize in programming or computer science means to copy someone else’s hard work. 
Which would pertain to anything that involves or consist of similar work such as ideas, text or even media. In today's society digital access is more available now more than ever.
 Therefore, it means that is very simply to just copy and paste someone else’s work, but just because we can do that does not mean that it is in fact the right thing to do.
 It makes it easier to carry out with the formatted plagiarized format, but much harder to detect. Because it is very simple to plagiarize someone's work it has become such a serious problem.
There are even laws intatct called "copy right laws" that ensures the publishers work will be protected by copyright ensuring that the work can only be copyrighted with approval of the publisher.
